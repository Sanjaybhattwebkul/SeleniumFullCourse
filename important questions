18 . Difference between LinkList And ArrayList ?

   // https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-arraylist-and-linkedlist

   1.  The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous. && The location for the elements of a linkedlist is not contagious.
   2.  An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only. && LinkedList class can act as a list and queue
   3.  ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. && LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
   4.  ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.  &&  LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
   5. 
      *> Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.
      *> There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList, an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.

    > Selenium Assertions can be of three types: “assert”, “verify”, and ” waitFor”. When an “assert” fails, the test is aborted. When a “verify” fails, the test will continue execution, logging the failure
