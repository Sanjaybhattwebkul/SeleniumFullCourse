18 . Difference between LinkList And ArrayList ?
   // https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-arraylist-and-linkedlist
   1.  ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. && LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
   2.  An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only. && LinkedList class can act as a list and queue
   3. The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous. && The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
   4.  ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.  &&  LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
   5. 
      *> Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.
      *> There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList, an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.
